>> At Vercel, I am excited about the opportunity to delve deeper into the intersection of customer feedback and product development. I want to learn more about how customer insights and feedback can directly influence and shape product features. This involves not only understanding the technical aspects of Vercel's offerings but also honing my ability to translate customer needs into actionable insights for the product team.

>> Additionally, I am eager to expand my skills in data analysis to identify trends and patterns in support tickets. By analyzing these trends, I can help proactively address recurring issues, ultimately reducing the number of support requests and improving the overall customer experience.

>> Another area I want to focus on is creating more comprehensive and accessible support resources, such as detailed documentation and engaging video tutorials. This aligns with my goal of empowering customers to find solutions independently and enhancing the self-service aspect of Vercel's support ecosystem.

>> Finally, I am keen to take on a more significant role in mentoring and training new support team members. By sharing my knowledge and experience, I can help build a strong, cohesive team that consistently delivers high-quality support to our customers.

>> Overall, my aim is to continuously improve the support process, contribute to product innovation, and ensure that every customer has a seamless and successful experience with Vercel.
