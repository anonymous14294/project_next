When encountering a build issue on an unfamiliar framework or technology, my approach involves systematic troubleshooting and effective communication with the customer. Here’s how I would proceed:

### Initial Steps in Troubleshooting:

1. Gather Contextual Information:
    - Begin by researching the framework or technology to understand its basics, common issues, and available documentation or community forums.
    - Look for any known issues or recent updates that might be relevant to the customer’s problem.


2. Request Detailed Information from the Customer:
    - To understand the situation better, I would ask the customer for specific details about the issue. Here are the questions I would ask:



### Questions to Ask the Customer:

1. Environment and Setup:
    - Can you provide details about your development environment (e.g., operating system, versions of the framework and dependencies, hardware specifications)?
    - Are you using any specific configurations or custom setups for your build process?

2. Issue Description:
    - Can you describe the issue you are experiencing in detail? What exactly happens during the build process (e.g., error messages, unexpected behavior, build failures)?

3. Steps to Reproduce:
    - Can you provide a step-by-step guide or script to reproduce the issue on our end?
    - Have you made any recent changes to your project or environment that might be related to the issue?

4. Logs and Error Messages:
    - Can you share any relevant logs, error messages, or screenshots that occur during the build process?
    - Are there any specific lines or segments in the logs that seem particularly relevant or recurring?

5. Previous Attempts to Resolve:
    - Have you tried any troubleshooting steps or fixes so far? If so, what were they, and what were the results?
    - Are there any similar issues you have encountered in the past with this framework, and how were they resolved?


### Continuing the Troubleshooting Process:

- Analyze the Information: With the gathered information, I would analyze the details to identify any obvious issues or patterns. This may involve comparing the customer’s setup to standard practices and configurations for the framework.
- Collaborate and Research: If the issue is complex, I might collaborate with colleagues who have more experience with the specific technology. Additionally, I would search through documentation, forums, and other resources to find potential solutions or similar cases.
- Communicate Clearly: Throughout the process, I would maintain clear and regular communication with the customer, updating them on my findings and the steps I’m taking. If necessary, I would set up a call or screen-sharing session to better understand the issue and provide more personalized support.
- Test and Validate: Once a potential solution is identified, I would test it in a controlled environment to ensure it addresses the issue without causing new problems. Then, I would guide the customer through implementing the solution in their environment.


By following this structured approach, I aim to resolve the customer’s issue efficiently while ensuring they feel supported and informed throughout the troubleshooting process.
