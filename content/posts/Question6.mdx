### Response

Hi There,

I’m sorry to hear about your frustration. I understand how challenging and time-consuming these issues can be, and I’m here to help you as quickly as possible.

To resolve this efficiently, I’ll need to gather some specific information about your setup. This will help me pinpoint the exact cause and find a solution. Could you please provide the following details:

1. Environment and Setup:
    - Your development environment (e.g., operating system, framework versions, hardware specifications).
    - Any specific configurations or custom setups you’re using?

2. Logs or Error Messages:
    - Any relevant logs or error messages you’re seeing during the build process.

I know it can be frustrating to provide these details, but they are crucial for me to diagnose and fix the issue accurately. Alternatively, if you prefer, we can set up a call or screen-sharing session where I can directly assist you in real time.

Thank you for your patience. I’m committed to resolving this for you and ensuring you have a smooth experience with our platform.

Best regards,
Abhishek
