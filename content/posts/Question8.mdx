## Response

Hi There,

Thank you for reaching out. 

If you’d like to prevent your site from being indexed by search engines, you can achieve this by adding a `robots.txt` file to your project. Here’s how you can do it:


#### Steps to Prevent Search Engine Indexing:

1. Create a robots.txt file in the root directory of your project.
    Add the following lines to the `robots.txt` file:
    ``` html
        User-agent: *
        Disallow: /
    ```

2. This will instruct all search engine crawlers to avoid indexing any pages of your site.
3. Deploy the changes to your Vercel project.


Additionally, if you want to ensure that individual pages are not indexed, you can add a `<meta>` tag to the `<head>` section of each HTML page:

`<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`

#### Implementing the robots.txt File:

1. Log in to your Vercel account and navigate to your project.
2. In your project directory, create a new file named robots.txt.
3. Add the lines mentioned above to the file and save it.
4. Deploy your project to apply the changes.


#### Verifying the Setup:

Once deployed, you can verify that the robots.txt file is accessible by visiting `https://example.com/robots.txt`.
You can also use tools like Google Search Console to check if your site is being indexed.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance with this process, please feel free to reach out. I'm here to help!

Best regards

Abhishek
